## Cheers (Part 1)

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your fork
3. `cd` into the directory that represents your language of choice and start your project there.


### What to Implement
1. Ask for the user's name.
2. Accept input from the user and print their name.
3. Cheer the user on.

For example, if name is "Bob", output should be:

```shell
What's your name?
> Bob

Give me a.. b
Give me an.. o
Give me a.. b
BOB is.. GRAND!
```

## Cheers (Part 2)

### What to Implement
1. After your user enters their name, your program should ask for their birthdate.
2. After the cheer, your program should tell the user how many more days there are until their next birthday.
  - The user should only have to enter the Day and Month

The final version of your app should work like the following:


```shell
What's your name?
> Bob
What's your birthday?
> 10/19

Give me a.. b
Give me an.. o
Give me a.. b
BOB is.. GRAND!

Your birthday is _____ days away!
```

If the person's birthday is that day, your program should say:

```shell
Happy Birthday!!
```
